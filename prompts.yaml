    You will be given a prompt or title for a story.
    The goal is to create a slow-paced, character-driven
    narrative with a short narrated time of at most two days.
    Your task is to come up with three distinct baselines
    for the story. Each baseline should be about 3 to 5
    sentences long. Make them as concrete as possible.
    For example, state what a character discovers instead
    of "secrets."

    You will be given a prompt or title for a story and multiple
    suggestions for a baseline. Your task is to first rate all
    baselines against different categories to generate a score
    (1-10) for each baseline. Then, choose the best baseline in
    the end. The categories are:

     - Does it make sense?
     - Is it witty?
     - Is it interesting?
     - Is the baseline concrete?


    Use the following format:

    Baseline 1: Makes sense: X, Witty: X, ..., Total: SUM

    Baseline 2: ...


    State what the best baseline is. In case of a tie,
    choose the one that better fits the prompt.

    Finally, repeat the text of the best baseline starting with "BEST BASELINE: ...".

    Characters are not only main characters but also side
    characters that might only appear once. Put every character
    in a separate object. Don't have "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" in one.

    Make sure to make up full names for the characters.
    Objects should only be important objects that play a major role
    in the story. This also includes vehicles or pets if they are
    not independent characters. Don't include items that are
    always carried by a character like a sword or a gun.

    Make up all the information that is not given in the prompt
    or summary to fill all fields with information that fits the
    story. Only leave a field empty if it is explicitly allowed.
    Make sure all fields are in english,
    regardless of the language of the prompt and summary.
    Most important: Be creative and let your imagination run wild.
    Include the most crazy characters you can think of. If you feel
    to be unconvential, use a uncommon narrator type. Make it as
    interesting as possible.

    Output only json. Nothing else.

    ## Introduction

    You will be given a JSON containing a template for a story.
    Your task is to simulate what is happening.
    Structure the simulation in paragraphs.
    Start with an outline in following format:

    P1: 5-10 words key note on what is being described

    P2: ...

    There shall be {MIN_PARAGRAPHS} to {MAX_PARAGRAPHS} paragraphs in total.

    ## Simulation guidelines
     - Simulate the environment: weather, season, light, colors, smells, sounds, temperature, air, ...
     - Also simulate characters inner life: thoughts, assessments, emotions, motivations, fears, past, future, ...
     - Simulate the interactions between characters: Dialogues in form of direct speech, feelings towards the other characters, thoughts of what the others may think, ...
     - Do not decrease the detail of simulation between paragraphs
    ## important

    Just give the outline don't do the simulation itself.
    Write the outline in the language of the summary.

    I don't like long epilogues, people reflecting and "preaching", so leave this away please.

    You will be given a JSON containing a template for a story,
    an outline of what is happening in all paragraphs, and the
    previous paragraphs (or None if this is the first paragraph).

    Your task is to simulate only paragraph number {PARAGRAPH_NUMBER}.
    Simulate it as a scene with great detail.
    Simulate it as the narrator given in the JSON.

    Use the language specified in the JSON.
    Use about {PARAGRAPH_WORDS} words.
    Where applicable, use direct speech and inner monologues.

  prompt: >
    You will be given a paragraph of a story, the previous
    paragraph (if there is one), the very first paragraph of
    the story and a JSON containing a list of characters and
    objects that appear in the story as well as the time and
    place of the story.
    The first and previous paragraph is included because it might
    contain information about the scenery or the characters
    that is not explicitly stated in the paragraph.
    
    Use this infomation to generate an image idea for
    the paragraph. Make sure to include time of day, time of year,
    and period of time as well as the place.

    Output a JSON using the following format:
    {
        "scenery": "A brief description of the scenery (max. 4 sentences)",
        "characters": ["Name of character from json"],
        "objects": ["Object1", "Object2"],
        "action": "Action that is happening in the scene",
        "mood": "A single word to convey the ambiance, i.e., happy, scary, dreary, etc.",
    }
    For the characters and objects field, only use character
    names and objects that are specified in the provided JSON.
    If you want to add more characters or objects, add them
    to scenery or action.
    Output only json. Nothing else.

    model: gpt-4-0613

  prompt: >
    ## Your Task
    You will be given a description of an image that includes
    scenery, characters, objects, action, and mood. Your task
    is to generate a very detailed prompt that can be used for
    the image creation tool stable diffusion.

    Imagine the scene. Provide information about the perspective,
    the lighting, the position of the characters, and where objects
    are placed. Try to understand the scene and make the image
    so that it makes the most sense. For instance, if you get the
    information that the character is wearing a backpack, and the
    scene depicts the character sitting down studying a map, you
    may place the backpack beside him on the ground.

    ## Things to Note
     - Start the prompt with the image type.
     - Then, describe the scenery, characters, objects and action each in only few words.
     - In the end, go into more detail about the characters appearance and use more descriptions of the scenery and lighting.
     - The prompt should be approximately 80 words long.
     - Use descriptive adjectives.
     - Favor short, simple sentences and comma-separated lists over complex sentences.
     - Use simple words and avoid jargon. If the given information uses complex words, simplify them.
     - Make everything extremely concrete.
     - Descirbe an instant in time, not a sequence of events.
     - Explicitly state the age and gender of each character.
     - When stating the age, don't use a number. Instead, use a word like "teenager" or "middle-aged".
     - Important: The prompt must be written in English. If the given information is not in English, translate it into English.

    ## Example
    Photorealistic image of a teenage boy sweeping of dust from a box in the basement. Eye-level shot. The boy is looking towards the viewer, with dark brown, messy hair, and bright blue eyes, ...
    Dark lighting, staircase in the background, light coming from the top of the stairs. ...
